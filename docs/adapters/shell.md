# Adapters: Shell

The shell adapter provides a simple read-eval-print loop for interacting with a brobbot locally.
It can be useful for testing scripts before using them on a live brobbot.

## Getting Started

To use the shell adapter you can simply omit the `-a` option when running
brobbot as it will use the shell adapter by default.

    % bin/brobbot

## Configuring

This adapter doesn't require any configuration.
