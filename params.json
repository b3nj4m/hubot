{"name":"Hubot","tagline":"A customizable life embetterment robot.","body":"# Brobbot\r\n\r\nBrobbot is a chat bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty\r\ncool. He's extendable with scripts, and can work on [many different chat services](docs/adapters.md).\r\n\r\nThis repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you\r\nuse for building your own bots.  See the [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)\r\nfor details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.\r\n\r\n## Forked from Hubot\r\n\r\nBrobbot was forked from Hubot. The main motivation being better support for scripts with persistent storage.\r\n\r\n### Key differences\r\n\r\n#### Loadable brain modules\r\n\r\nBrobbot's brain can be a simple Javascript object held in-memory (the deafult `dumb` brain), but you can also load a different brain module to enable a large, fast, persistent brain.\r\nBrobbot's brain operations return promises to make your async code nice and clean.\r\nBrain modules can also provide a `ready` promise in order to signal that the brain is connected/authenticated/whatever it needs to do before it's ready.\r\nCheck out [the brain docs](docs/brains.md) for more info.\r\n\r\nTo load a brain module, use the `-b` switch when running `bin/brobbot`. e.g.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbin/brobbot -b redis\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Message queues\r\n\r\nBrobbot maintains a message queue for each message handler, which means your handler can opt to process one message at a time with no concurrency.\r\n\r\n#### Improved listener regex matching\r\n\r\nBrobbot removes its name from the beginning of messages addressed to it before testing regexen against the message. This means that you can safely use anchors (`^`) at the beginning of your `respond` regex, which helps reduce false-positives.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
